<h1>Premise</h1>

<p>The first season premiered on October 3, 2004, and introduces the four central
    characters of the show: Susan Mayer, Lynette Scavo, Bree Van de Kamp and Gabrielle Solis,
    as well as their families and neighbors on Wisteria Lane. </p>

    <p>The main mystery of the season is the unexpected suicide of Mary Alice Young, and the involvement
    of her husband Paul Young (Mark Moses) and their son Zach (Cody Kasch) in the events 
    leading up to it. Susan fights promiscuous neighbor Edie Britt(Nicollette Sheridan) 
    for the affection of new neighbor Mike Delfino (James Denton), Lynette struggles to 
    cope with her four demanding children, Bree fights to save her marriage to Rex Van
    de Kamp (Steven Culp) while dealing with her rebellious son Andrew Van de Kamp (Shawn
    Pyfrom), and Gabrielle tries to prevent her husband from discovering that she is 
    having an affair with their gardener, John Rowland (Jesse Metcalfe). The first season 
    is also marked by mystery surrounding the murder of a neighbor and some
    secrets revealed about Zach, Mike, and Paul. At the end of the season both Paul 
    and Zach go missing. </p>

<h1> Cast and Characters</h1>

<p>During its premiere season, the show featured thirteen starring actors, all 
    credited in the opening sequence. For the show's second year, several actors, 
    mainly child and teenage ones, who had guest starred during the first season,
    were promoted to series regulars without having their names included in the opening
    sequence. Instead, they were billed as "also starring" during the first minutes of each
    episode, together with episode guest stars. This practice continued for the rest of
    the season.

<h1>Filming</h1>
<p>Desperate Housewives was filmed on Panavision 35 mm cameras (except for the final
season, which was shot digitally on the Arri Alexa.) It was broadcast in standard
and widescreen high definition, though it was framed for the 4:3 aspect ratio until the 
final season. </p>

<p>The set for Wisteria Lane, consisting mainly of facades but also of some
actual houses, was located on the Universal Studios Hollywood back lot. It was referred
to by film crews as Colonial Street, and has been used for several motion pictures and 
television shows since the mid-1940s. Notable productions that were filmed here include:
So Goes My love, Leave it to the Beaver, The 'Burbs, Providence, Deep Impact, Bedtime for Bonzo,
The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, Gremlins, The Munsters, Psycho, Buffy the Vampire 
Slayer, and the Doris Day comedies The Thrill of It All and Send Me No Flowers. For the second
season of Desperate Housewives, the street underwent some significant changes. Among the most
noticeable of these changes was the removal of a church facade and a mansion in order to make 
room for Edie's house and a park. Interior sets were built on sound stages at Universal Studios
Hollywood, some of which were duplicated in some form on the Wisteria Lane back lot for filming 
when conditions required it. Filming for the series ended April 26, 2012.</p>
